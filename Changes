0.12 Wed 20 October 2004
------------------------

  * (20 Oct 2004) oops

  * (20 Oct 2004) update release notes

  * (20 Oct 2004) some fixes
  	Need to build META.yml in the test target now.
  	Also need to fix version_bump_files to be defined empty.


0.11 Wed 20 October 2004
------------------------

  * (20 Oct 2004) some fixes
  	Need to build META.yml in the test target now.
  	Also need to fix version_bump_files to be defined empty.


0.10 Wed 20 October 2004
------------------------

  * (20 Oct 2004) added version_bump_files
  	Found that using just version_bump_code for custom version changes
  doesn't work if the changes involve test .ok files, because trying to
  commit version-id changes non-atomically will therefore fail if darcs
  test is set, since the version-ids will be out of sync.
  	Therefore, add another paramter, version_bump_files, to list
  the files that were changed by the version_bump_code, so that the actual
  commit of all files with version-ids in them can be done atomically.


0.06 Tue 19 October 2004
------------------------

  * (19 Oct 2004) added commit_todo option
  	Realized that some setups need one to commit the TODO file
  as well as the .todo file.

  * (19 Oct 2004) added option to change name of README file


0.05 Tue 12 October 2004
------------------------

  * (12 Oct 2004) fixing Changes format workaround
  	For the first version, there is no "release-" tag, so the
  first "darcs changes" command doesn't work.  I'd been making do with
  just calling 'darcs changes' by itself, but that gave the old format
  rather than the compact format, so now changed to check the command
  beforehand, and change the command, so that one always gets the
  compact format.


0.04 Sun 10 October 2004
------------------------

  * (10 Oct 2004) fixing README version problem
  	Because the README was being generated before the version_bump
  was done, then it had the wrong version number in it.


0.03 Sun 10 October 2004
------------------------

  * (10 Oct 2004) tweaking Changes format


0.02 Sun 10 October 2004
------------------------

  * (10 Oct 2004) updating documentation

  * (10 Oct 2004) fixing Changes stuff
  	- workaround for darcs changes bug
  	- changed the format of the changes generated by the auto-changes stuff

  * (10 Oct 2004) fixing VERSION stuff
  	Looks like the VERSION change stuff wasn't quite working.


0.01 Sun 10 October 2004
------------------------

  * (10 Oct 2004) fixing darcs_release
  	Ooops, didn't update to OO there!

  * (10 Oct 2004) tweaking changes

  * (10 Oct 2004) darcs auto-test stuff now on-line

  * (10 Oct 2004) tweaking README stuff
  	Now the README generation is a bit more generous in the sections
  which it selects.

  * (10 Oct 2004) darcs tweaking stuff

  * (10 Oct 2004) getting into the groove
  	Changes to make this (a) work properly and (b) work better.
  Changed the format of the version.txt file, made the config file be
  read in by the module not the script, made more "test" kind of options
  to the module and script.

  * (10 Oct 2004) initial checkin
  	A proper module for my "developers aid" tools.
